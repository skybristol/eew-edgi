There are some cases then, where an industry concept like \"Wholesale Trade Agents and Brokers\" can be an Industry Subsector, Industry Group, Industry (multi-national), and Industry (national). I think this is workable in the knowledge graph in that some given facility or a commercial company could link to one given concept based on any of the codes applied to that entity in source data. When we establish the linkage, we'll record the hierarchical level of significance to the linkage as a qualifer.
